                     <p>The state of West Virginia has had its fair share of strange and often inexplicable events such the visitation of the Flatwoods Monster and Indrid Cold, but perhaps the strangest yet is the arrival of the creature known as the Mothman, who changed the sleepy little town of Point Pleasant forever when it swooped in one cold autumn night in 1966.
                        <br/><br/>Today, Mothman is one of the most well-known cryptids in the world, made famous partly by John Keel's book (later adapted to film) The Mothman Prophecies. Mothman is also hunted in Mountain Monsters on Destination America.

                     <p>El Chupacabra is a cryptid that is renowned for its attacks on livestock, hence the Spanish name "the goatsucker." It supposedly eats chickens, goats, and other farm animals and pets. It has been reported all over the Americas, specifically the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico. There are two common versions of the chupacabra. There is a reptilian kind - the true chupacabra - and a canid kind, which are also called blue dogs. There have been more than 2,000 sightings of both types.  When it sucks blood, it allegedly makes an odd noise.</p>

                     <p>The Dark Watchers of California are a group of mysterious dark human-like creatures who stand on the hills, ridges, and peaks of the Santa Lucia Mountains. They supposedly watch those who wander into the mountains and are not aggressive. They are most often spotted around twilight and are usually seen staring upwards toward the sky while standing atop the mountains. They seem to be some sort of spirits however their origins are currently unknown.<br /><br />
                        They’ve been seen many times over the years, with stories about them dating back to Chumash Indian legends. They are mentioned in the short story "Flight" by John Steinbeck and the iconoclastic poet Robinson Jeffers wrote about “forms that look human…but certainly are not human” in his poem, “Such Counsels You Gave to Me.” Sometime in the mid-sixties, a Monterery Peninsula local and former high school principal went on a hiking trip in the Santa Lucias when he suddenly spotted a dark figure in a hat and a cape, standing on a rock and surveying the area. When the principal called out to the other hikers, the creature vanished. More sightings continue to be made to this day.

                     <p>The Dover Demon is a small humanoid reported from Dover, Massachusetts. It was the subject of an intensive scare during the 1970s, when multiple witnesses came forward with their sightings. The Dover Demon is described as looking sort of like the "gray" variety of alien, except that it has skin of a rosy orange instead of sickly gray. The Dover Demon has a large head on a small, stick-like body. It can be bipedal, but it often travels on all fours or switches back and forth between the two modes of locomotion. It has eyes that glow, sometimes orange, sometimes green. It does not seem to wear any clothing, unless the clothing fits tightly and is the same color as its body. Unlike the grays, the Dover Demon does not seem to be associated with UFOs. It just wanders around on its own. <br /> <br />
                        Cryptozoologists seldom show interest in the Dover Demon. Mainstream Cryptozoologists are rarely willing to seriously investigate humanoids other than hairy humanoids. It seems that sightings only happened during a short time period, with most claiming that sightings have now ceased, so the Dover Demon does not seem to be a pressing matter.

The creatures themselves have been sighted in Clermont County. The Loveland frogmen are bipedal frogs as made evident due to their leathery skin as well as their webbed hands and feet. The creatures have frog-like heads with wrinkly skin on top of them. They are around 1 meter tall.</p>

                     <p>Many theories have been presented in relation to the identity of Lizard Men, theories such as living dinosaurs, and even offshoots of evolution in which the reptilian hierarchy continued to evolve along the same path as early primates. At one point in time reptiles ruled the earth, it is not out of the realm of possibility that the most dominate species on the planet could continue to evolve in small numbers unseen by mankind. Although no reptilian species known to man have shown signs of such advanced evolution, the reptile is the oldest and most successful species on the planet and could hold secrets that have yet to come to light. In Lee County, South Carolina, a strange reptilian humanoid was reported on several accounts.</p>

                     <p>In many Native American legends, a skin-walker (or skinwalker) is a person with the supernatural ability to turn into any creature they desire. To be able to transform, legend sometimes requires that the skin-walker wears a pelt of the animal. In most cases, this pelt is not used in modern times because it is an obvious sign of them being skin-walkers. It's a common theme found throughout cultures all over the world and is referred to as shapeshifting by anthropologists. These creatures are sighted interestingly a lot now-a-days.<br /><br />
                        Many Native Americans dislike the fact that Skin-walkers appear in modern media, because of the superstition that mentioning them might cause them to hunt the mentioning person down. This is the same reason why they don't like talking about them with not-Natives.

In some forms, the Wendigo is the size of a human, while in others, it can be fifteen-feet-tall. The earliest description of the Wendigo was that of similar appearance to a corpse, with a skeleton-like, thin body with gray skin, sunken eyes, bloody lips, yellow fangs and a long, slimy tongue. Later myths say that the Wendigo is a lipless ape with giant fangs that devours human flesh. It can turn a person into a Wendigo, which was one of the worst curses to the Algonquian-speaking Native Americans of Canada.</p>

                        A Bigfoot is a heavy, bipedal humanoid ape. It is believed that Bigfoot stands at around eight to ten feet tall--however the Hibagon stands at only four to five feet--and has long arms. It has dense fur, ranging in colors from red, to white, to brown. It has very large feet, which is why it is called "Bigfoot." Some people believe that Bigfoot is the descendant of the prehistoric giant orangutan Gigantopithecus, whereas others think it descended from prehistoric homininds such as a Neanderthal Man or Australopithecus. Some sightings of Bigfoot can be traced back to bears.
